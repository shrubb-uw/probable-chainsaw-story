A traveling adventurer is walking down a forest path. The adventurer is tired, having been on the road for months now. Searching for glory, riches, and fame. As the light fades from the sky, the adventurer sees a village off in the distance.

The adventurer decides that since he is so tired, he should go into the villiage to see if he can find a good place to sleep and take a break from his adventuring. So he makes his way through the forest into the village. In the village, he finds his way to a nice little hotel and enters it.

He enters the hotel, while it looks extremely beautiful, not unlike a fancy European castle, he notices that there is nobody at the front desk. As the adventurer walks up to the front desk to ring the 
bell he sees that his name is included in the list of checked in guests, which immediately takes him aback. 

Mystified, he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a still-warm, iron 
key. He had snatched it from a dragon's jaw just weeks prior, escaping a 
firey demise with nothing but his life and the one thing from the dragon's 
hoard that had been travel-sized. He had pondered the mysterious engraving 
- the numbers 713 - wondering if they were a secret code, perhaps, or the 
answer to a long-sought riddle.

It dawns on him just then - it was simply the number to his room.
