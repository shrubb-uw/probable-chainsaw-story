A traveling adventurer is walking down a forest path. The adventurer is tired, having been on the road for months now. Searching for glory, riches, and fame. As the light fades from the sky, the adventurer sees a village off in the distance.

The adventurer decides that since he is so tired, he should go into the villiage to see if he can find a good place to sleep and take a break from his adventuring. So he makes his way through the forest into the village. In the village, he finds his way to a nice little hotel and enters it.
